# Demonstrating-principal-component-analysis-using-digits-dataset
This case study  demonstrates the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and its impact on classification performance. It starts by loading the "digits" dataset from scikit-learn's datasets module, which contains images of handwritten digits. The code then preprocesses the data by standardizing it and calculating the covariance matrix and its eigenvalues/eigenvectors. It calculates and plots the variance explained by each principal component and their cumulative sum to decide how many components to retain.
Afterwards, the code uses PCA to transform the data while retaining 95% of the variance. It then splits the data into training and testing sets, and trains a logistic regression model on both the original and PCA-transformed data, evaluating their accuracy on the testing set. Additionally, the code performs the same process using a Decision Tree classifier and measures the accuracy of the predictions.
